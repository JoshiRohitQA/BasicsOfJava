Package - any number of projects
Class- any number of projects

Projects - 
Package - under project-lower case

Uppercase- ROHIT
Lowercase-rohit
camelCase-rohitJoshi

class -it is where u write program


Tokens - These are smallest units of any program
is like human body and its the java body 
 types of tokens
Identifiers- It is the name given to class name
Rules for identifier
1) Always start with Capital letter ex- Addition
2) It can be alphanumeric ex- Add123
3) It can have _ but no other special character ex- Find_salary
4) It can not start with numeric
5) If it has 2 words then write in this way RohitJoshi

Class-3

Keywords- These are the reserved words which has it own meaning , keywords can never be the identifier , in Java
we have almost 50 keywords
ex- abstract , assert, boolean, break, byte, case, char, etc.
Every Java keywords will be pink in color-for knowledge
all java keywords will be in lowercase

Literals - These are the values used in the program
seperators- Seperators are used in Java to separate the code from each other 
some of the seperators in Java are 
;-semi column
,-comma
[]-brackets
()-paranthesis
{}-braces

comments- If u dont want any line of code to be executed by Java u can comment it 
comment is not deleting it only means ignoring
These are of two type 
Single line comments- used for single line
Multi line comments- used for multiple lines 

syntax- /* int num =1;
int numss =2;
*/

operators- A+B
here + is the operator 
A and B are operands
these are symbols in Java which can perform operations in java
+,-,*,=,==,/,<,>,<=,>=,!=,&&,||,!,%,etc.
%= modulus operator
"="= assignment operator
"=="= equals operator
(IK LS CO)- shortcut to remember



Every body needs a heart
same every Java class needs a main method



Java is a case sensitive language
SQL is not case sensitive language
In Java everything will be line by line execution

Class-4

How Java Internally works
We write code in human understandable language then it will go through two stages 
first compilation that checks for compile time error that it will check for syntax rules then it will translate the .java file into .class file it is also known as intermediate class which is neither understandable by human nor by the operating system

then interpretation that checks for runtime error , runtime error often leads to exception, it reads line by line and it will translate the .class file into binary and execute
in interpretation there are 4 components
JDK-Java Development kit - it has the library files which is required to run the program
JRE-Java runtime environment- It provides the environment for ur java to go and run the program
JVM-Java Virtual machine- It is something which is not physically present but present virtually it is responsible for execution of ur program
starting from main method
JIT- Just in Time- this is responsible for converting .class file into binary

at last gives binary as output

Java is a platform independent programming language
 public static void main(String [] args){

}
public is access specifier 
And there are 4 access specifier
public 
private
protected 
package/default

static- modifier
there are 2 types of modifier
static
non static

void - Return type
byte
short
int
long
float
double
char
String
boolean
void

main - main method name

String[] args- parameter

can u change ur main method at all?
NO


Class -5

How to use 
if want program 
public-we can write it
private-we can write it
protected--we can write it
package/default - dont have to write it


static -we can write it
non-static- dont have to write it

parameters
add()- non-parametrized
add(int a)-parametrized


create multiple methods
1 static methods

public static void add(){

}-valid method

static void sub(){

}-valid method

private void multiply(){

}-valid method

protected static String name(){

}-valid method

static void addition(int a, int b){

}-valid method

void boolean(String name){

} - not a valid method as using 2 return types

boolean Dinner(String name){

}-valid method


How to call a static method inside a main method ?
package basicprograms;

public class How_to_call_staticmethod {
	
	static void addition() {
		System.out.println("I am your addition method");
	}
	
	static void subtraction() {
		System.out.println("I am your subtraction method");
	}
	
	static void multiply() {
		System.out.println("I am your multiplication method");
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println("I am your main method");
		addition();
		subtraction();
		multiply();
	}

}


Data type and Variables
Every data should have datatype in java

Data types
byte- number -74
short-number - 5423
int-number   - 
long-number  -
float-decimal- 
double-decimal-
char-character  - A,s,S
boolean-true or false - true or false
String- anything ex- name,address,city,etc. - Rohit


We have a formula to calculate the range of each datatype

-2 ki power r to 2 ki power n-1 -1
n -is size in bits


1TB-1024gb
1GB-1024mb
1MB-1024kb
1KB-1024byte
1byte-8bits


      byte     bits
byte  1          8
short 2          16
int   4          32
long  8          64


lets calculate range for byte
n=8
so range will be 
-128 to 127

range for short
-32768 to 32767


Class 6

Datatypes and Variables

variable is a container holding the value

datatype variable = value;
byte a=90;
byte is datatype
a is variable
= is assignment operator
90 is value

variable can be alphabet
alphanumeric
any word
can have _ in between

byte age=90;
byte age_1=91;

byte a=90;//declaration and initialization of variable a with value 90
short b=32000;
int c= 8292922;
long d=232323223;
float e=3.13f;
double a1=90.123;
char a2= 'S';
boolean a3= true;
boolean a4= false;
String name ="Test";

String is a predefined class

How to update the value of local variable 

byte age;//decleration
age=19; //initialization
age=20; // update
sysout(age);
now age will be 20 as updated to 20

String name ="Test";
		name ="Rohit";
		System.out.println(name);
name will be updated to Rohit

Operators
these are symbols in Java which can perform operations in java 
Arithmetic operators"
+ - * % /



How to access non-static method
we can define non static method anywhere inside or outside main class

by creating an object with the help of its reference variable

Syntax of creating an object

Classname variable = new Classname();

Is it possible to have static and non-static methods present in same class
Yes


Class 7

Method overloading
Creating multiple methods with same name but variation in the argument list is known as method overloading 
In java we can overload both static as well as non-static methods
It means repeating method in java is not possible
void add(){

}

void add(){

}

What do you mean by variation in the argument list
Variation in argument list means
1 Number of argument
2 Order of occurrence of argument
3 Different types of argument

void add(int a, double b, char c){

}

void add(int a){
}

ex- in amazon we can login with email as well as mobile number

void login(String email_id){

}

void login(long mobile_number){
}


Constructors
These are the special types of methods in Java which does not have a return type
Constructors are always non-static
They will always have the same name as class name
constructors it can have any Access specifier

public class Amazon{
 
Amazon(){

}// this is the constructor

public static void main(String[] args){

}

}

How to call a constructor
It gets call automatically when u create an object


Syntax of creating an object

classname refrerence_variable = new classname();
or
new classname();

There are two types of constructors
Parameterized constructor
Non-parameterized constructor

Constructor overloading
Creating multiple constructors but variation in the argument list is known as constructor overloading
Variation in argument list means
1 Number of argument
2 Order of occurrence of argument
3 Different types of argument


Class 8
Types of variables
3 types of variables
Local variable 
Global variable
Final variable

Local variable
Any variable that is declared inside any method is known as local variable
Scope of local variable is only within the method
modifiers- local variables can not be distinguished between static and non-staic
default value- They do not have any default value
local variable can never be utilized without initialization
how to define - 
int age = 90;
or
int age;//declaration
age =90;//initialization




Global variable
Any variable that is declared outside any method but inside the class is known as Global variable
Scope of global variable is from the start of class till the end of class
modifiers - they can be distinguish between static and non-static
default value- They have a default value 
ex- 0 for byte,short,int,long
0.0 for double and float
false fir Boolean datatypes
null for String datatype
not defined for char datatype
global variable can be utilized without initialization
how to define - 
double pi;
or 
double pi=3,14;
but you can not write as 
double pi;
pi=3.14;



How to update value for global variable
if it is static then in main method simple change the value

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		pi=5;
		System.out.println(pi);
          }

if it is non static then create the object then through reference variable update the non staic global variable
public static void main(String[] args) {
		Global_variable g1 = new Global_variable();
		g1.number_of_days_leap_year=90;
		System.out.println(g1.number_of_days_leap_year);
		
	}


Final variable
Any variable which is final can never change its value

It can be used for local and global variable also



Class 9
looping in Java
For loop
syntax 
for(initialization and declaration; Condition; Increment/Decrement){

 logic;
 
}

for loop only works when condition is true

Conditional/Comparison Operator
"<,>,>=,<=,==,!="

Increment Operator i++
Decrement Operator i--

ex1-
for(i=1;i<2;i++){
 system.out.println("Hello");
}

Condition: 1<2 true
Output:Hello


Conditional Statements
there are 4 types
1 If block
2 If Else block
3 If Else If block
4 Nested If Else block

syntax of if block
if(condition){

logic;

}
condition-true or false
only when condition true if block will execute



Class 10
If block

if else if block
In case of Ifelse if block whichever condition is true first that will execute

Nested if else
syntax

if(c1){

if(c2){

}
else{
}

}

}

else{
}
 IN nested if else block any type of conditional statement can be present in if or else

case 1 - If c1 is true parent else will never execute 


Assignement - 1 Check if age >=18 if yes can vote else can not vote
2 Gender 
char gender1='Male'
char gender2='Female'

if('Female'){
travelling is free
}
else
{
if less than 12 or equals to 12 -half ticket
else if more than 12 till 59 -full ticket
else more than 60 -senior citizen ticket
}


Logical Operators
and  &&
or   ||
not   !

Table for And

c1      c2    output
True    True   True
False   True   False
False   False  False 
True    False  False


Table for OR

c1      c2    output
True    True   True
False   True   True
False   False  False 
True    False  True

Table for Not

condition  output   
True       False 
False      True   

AO "+,-,*,/,%"
CO ">,<,==,<=,>=,!="
LO  "&&,||,!"

Class 11

Scanner class in Java
Scanner class in Java is used to take human input at the run time
Scanner class is present under java util package


Compile time - We assign the values of our variable before running the program
Run time  - We assign the values of our variable after running the program

//System.in -to take the value at run time
//System.out- to print the value

Scanner class methods
next()- is to accept String value at the runtime
nextbyte()- is to accept byte value at runtime
nextshort()- is to accept short value at runtime
nextint()- is to accept int value at runtime
nextlong()- is to accept long value at runtime
nextfloat()- is to accept float value at runtime
nextdouble()- is to accept double value at runtime
nextboolean()- is to accept boolean value at runtime

How to initialize the value of each method under scanner class


Class 12
How to get run time exception
When user input the mismatch value of variable from the datatype of variable then it gives value mismatch exception at the runtime

Solve problem using scanner class

calculate area of triangle
calculate area of rectangle
calculate circumference of circle
calculate circumference of rectangle
calculate circumference of triangle
calculate area of trapezium

 
Math Class
Math class is present in java.lang package
anything which is present in java.lang package we not need to import it
Math class only have static methods in it
if you want to access static method of a class use below way:
Classname.method()
Math.random()-gives you unique value between 0 and 1 and its answer will be in double



Class 13

Inheritance in Java
Inherirting the properties of one class into another class is known as Inheritance in Java
Property of class means methods and variables

we can inherit
static and non-static methods
static and non-static variables


we cant inherit
Constructors can not be inherited in Java

we need concept of inheritance for the code reusability

a class can make relation with another class using extends keyword

subclass(child class) extends superclass (parent class)


we dont create object of parent class always try to create object of child class

Inheritance types

Single level Inheritance
It is where a single sub class is inheriting the property from single super class 

Multi level Inheritance
One class inherits another class which also inherits another class is called as Multi Level Inheritance

sub class->super class->super most class


Multiple level Inheritance   
In multiple level inheritance a single sub class inherits properties from many super classes

It is not possible to achieve in Java using class concept but same is possible to achieve in java using interface concept
// diagram in diagram folder

Also in java
class A extends B,C->will give comiple time error

Diamond Problem //Diagram in diagram folder



Hierarchal level Inheritance
In hierarchal level inheritance many subclasses inherits the properties from a single super class
// diagram in diagram folder


Hybrid level Inheritance



Note- subclass(child class) having main method is the only class that is in package explorer


Class 14

Hybrid level Inheritance
//diagram in diagram folder

It is the combination of single level , multilevel and heirarichal level Inheritance


Object Class
It is the root class of entire class hierarchy 
This relation is present implicitly


Method Overriding
Developing a method in the parent class with the same name and signature as the child class but with different implementation is known Method Overriding

super class 
-method
implementation 1

sub class 
-method
implementation 2
 

decleration	int a;
initilization	a=100;
utilization	sysout(a)
implemenattion	method body

What do you mean signature of method?
Signature of method means method return type and the parameters

Rules to achieve Method Overriding
1) Both method should have same name
2) We can override only non-static method
3) Both class must have a relation with each other

super keyword in java is used in concept of method overriding to call the parent class implementation together with the child class implementation
super keyword in java has to be utilized only in case of a non-static method
super keyword can be the first line or second line or any line in the non-static method


Class 15
Super Calling
super calling statement is used to call parent class constructor from the child class constructor
super calling statement should always be the first line in every constructor

super()-super calling statement can be of 2 types

parameterized super calling statement should only be called explicitly
non-parameterized super calling statement can be called both implicitly or explicitly

implicitly means by itself
explicitly means forcefully


this()-This statement
It is use to call one constructor from another constructor within the same class
this() has to be the first line in every constructor
this() are of two types
parameterized 
non-parameterized
this() can be written explicitly only

Note- Any constructor can newer be the combination of super calling statement and this calling statement


Class 16

This keyword
With the help of this keyword the value of rhs will asssing to lhs
this.global_variable = local_vairable;

this keyword should only be used in non-static context[non-static methods and variables]
It can only be used in case of global variable parameters are same as method parameters/local parameters
It can be in any line no need to be first line
It will be used in parameterized method


Switch Case in Java

switch(case)
{
case 1: logic;
        break;
case 2: logic;
        break;
case 3: logic;
        break;
default:
        logic;
       
}


String Function // important for interview

It is class and it has many methods

String a= "Ram";
or
String s1 = new Sting("Ram");
a.list of methods= list of string functions (non-static methods)


length 
charAt(index)
indexOf(charint)
trim
tolowercase
touppercase

B A N G A L O R E
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 


Class 17

length 
charAt(index)
indexOf(charint)
trim - removes space from the starting and ending of string not from the middle of string
tolowercase
touppercase

equals- It is use to compare the value of two strings
concat-combining one string with another string
equalsIgnoreCase- ignores case and gives output in Boolean

StringIndexOutOfBoundsException- if try to print something beyond the string index


System.out.println();- print statement and moves to next line 
System.out.print(); -  print statement and does not move to next line


tocharArray


Array
Array in java is used to store the homogenous value together
Syntax:

datatype variable[] = new datatype[Size];
or
datatype[] variable = new datatype[Size];

Please create an array of int datatype to store the roll no of 3 students
int rollno[] = new int[3];
rollno[0]=21;
rollno[1]=22;
rollno[2]=22;


Please create an array of String datatype to store the name of 3 students
String name[] = new String[3];
name[0]="rohit";
name[1]="sandeep";
name[2]="atul";

if the size of array is bigger and u stored less values then it prints the default value of datatype


Arrays.toString(variable)- use to print data in the array 

ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException



can we change the size of array at runtime
no

can we change the size of array at compile time
yes

How to update the value of array
yes
int[0]=10;
int[0]=11;


can array accept duplicate values?
yes

can array accept null value?
yes it can accept for String datatype    null means (unknown value)


can array accept hetrogenous value?
no


Can we sort an array?
Yes
Arrays.sort(variable)


Class 18

[r,a,m]
[a,r,m]

After sorting
[r,a,m]-[a,m,r]
[a,r,m]-[a,m,r]


Class 22

Drawbacks of Array
1) The size is fixed 
2) It can only store homogenous value


Abstract class
Any class which has abstract methods are called as abstract class

Abstract methods
Abstract methods are those methods which has no real implementation

Abstract class can never be the child class

Any abstract class can have abstract method as well as concrete method


Ex-
void add();
void login();

Facts on abstract methods
1) Every abstract method needs to be non-static
2) Every abstract method needs to be overridden
3) If method is abstract class is abstract
4) Any abstract method need to be written as
abstract void login();


Concrete methods
These are those methods which has implementation
ex-
void add(){

}


concrete class
These are those classes which has only concrete methods

Difference between abstract and concrete class
Abstract class
Will always have abstract method
It can also have concrete method
To write abstract class we need to use a keyword called as Abstract
Abstract methods need to be overridden
Abstract method must be non-static
Abstract class must be the parent class only so that its abstract method can be override in child
ex-
abstract class Test{

abstract void add();

}


Concrete class
will only have concrete method
It will never have abstract method
To write the concrete class we dont need to use a keyword
Concrete methods are not mandatory to be overridden
Concrete methods can be static and non-static
Concrete class can be any class either child or even parent
ex-

class Conc{

void add(){

}

}



Class 23 

Interface 
Interface are used in java to achieve 100percent abstraction
Interface will only have the abstract methods

Relationship diagram of class , abstract class and interface

implements keyword is use to create relationship between class and interface

Interface can not make relationship with class and abstract class as Interface can never be child

Under Interface no need to write abstract for abstract methods


Difference between abstract class and Interface

Abstract class
can have both abstract and concrete method
Cant achieve multiple level inheritance
Abstract class can achieve 0-100 percent abstraction
from abstract class to class relation is possible
class can create relationship with abstract class using extends keyword
abstract class can have any access specifier
abstract methods can take any access specifier for methods


Interface 
can only have abstract method
is use to achieve to multiple level inheritance
100 percent abstraction
from interface to class relation is not possible
class can create relationship with interface using implements keyword
interface are by default public
interface methods are by default public in nature



Class 24

What is Abstraction
Hiding the implementation of a class and exposing only what is required is known as abstraction

Abstraction can be achieved by Abstract class and Interface

With Abstract class we can achieve 0-100 percent abstraction 

With Interface we can achieve 100 percent abstraction 


Access Specifier

public 
private
protected
package/default


behavior of access specifier with class

Any class can have just 2 access specifier in java that is public and package/default

What is meaning of class being public?
A class which is public can be access within the package and outside the package as well


What is meaning of class being default/package?
A class being default/package that it can be access within the package only.


behavior of access specifier with methods

Any method can have all 4 types of access specifier in java 



	     With in the class?	        In a package?	          Outside the package by becoming sub class?   Outside package without becoming subclass? 
private	        TRUE		           False	                            FALSE                                      FALSE                      
package/default	TRUE	                   TRUE		                            FALSE                                      FALSE
protected	TRUE	                   TRUE		                            TRUE                                       FALSE
public		TRUE	                   TRUE	                                    TRUE                                       TRUE
				
				
	class 1 	have methods of different access specifier		
	class 2	        try to call methods of class 1 in main method of class2		
				
				
				
Outside the package by becoming sub class?				
package 1	class 1 	have methods of different access specifier		
package 2	class 2         extends class1 and have main method		
				
				
Outside the package without becoming sub class?				
package 1	class 1 	have methods of different access specifier		
package 2	class 2         create object of class 1 in main method		
				
				
Behaviour of access specifier with interface				
				
What is meaning of interface being public?				
A interface can be access within the package and outside the package as well				


Continue Keyword
It is use to skip a particular iteration



I need to peddle 50 times to reach office- Loop count you are aware
I need to keep peddling until I reach office- Loop count you are not aware

whenever you aware with loop count use for loop
whenever you are not aware with loop count use while loop


Class 25

Syntax of while loop

Declaration and initialization
while(condition)
{
Logic;

i++;

}


SIB IIB
Blocks in Java
SIB
static initialization block
syntax

static
{


}

IIB
instance initialization block
syntax

 {


 
 }

How to invoke SIB
If main method is present SIB will call automatically

How to invoke IIB
by creating object


main method always execute when SIB is absent because when SIB is present SIB will execute first then main method will execute


Order of execution is different from output of the program
Class-SIB and main method
order of execution - SIB,Main method
Output - 

Multiple SIB - yes possible any number of Sib can be present in program
Order of execution - Line by line
Output - order of output depends how u want it will execute line by line

One object creation will invoke all the IIBs

IIB and SIB can not be parameterized , blocks can not be parameterized

What will be the order of execution 
IIB
SIB
main method
constructor

Ans
SIB
main method
IIB
constructor


Why SIB?

SIB is use to set Pre condition

Developers will use this concept to create connection with database


assert keyword

assert                Java
Assert (Class)        TestNg
SoftAssert (Class)    Selenium
HardAssert (Class)    Selenium


Assertion
Comparison of expected behaviour with the actual behaviour is known as Assertion


Syntax 1:
assert condition;

Suntax 2:

assert condition :(error message);


Run configuration 
under vm arguments
vm -ea


Class 26

Exception Handling

whenever any exception comes it terminates the program

It can be done in java using 2 keywords
one is try and another is catch

Syntax:
try{

//which ever line giving exception

}
catch(ExceptionName variable)
{

//it must be handled here

}

Note:
1 Whichever line is giving exception should be under try block
2 And it must be handled under catch block
3 Writing try and catch block does not means exception is mandatory to come
4 If exception comes then try block will not execute and catch block will execute
5 If exception does not comes then try block will execute and catch block will never execute
6 For every 1 try there can be one catch or multiple catches block


We want exception handling for the continuity of program

Assignment
Array size 4
and enter 5 values
and handle it using exception handling



Class 27

        int rollno[]=new int[3];        
        rollno[0]=85;
        rollno[1]=96;
        rollno[2]=55;
where size is coming from scanner class 
try to get 2 exception one for nextint and other for outofbound.
handle it carefully to avoid termination"	


Finally block
It should be used in case of exception handling to execute some necessary actions that developer wants to in the case of exception handling because
we are not sure try block will execute or catch block will execute but what we are sure is finally block
1 try with 10 catches
1 try with 1 catches


Syntax:
try{

//which ever line giving exception

}
catch(ExceptionName variable)
{

//it must be handled here

}
finally{

}

try to handle string index out of bond exception through try and catch


Throw keyword
It can be used in java to throw the exception

Syntax:

throw new

throw new exceptionname();
or
throw new exceptionname("Message");


Throw                                                    Throws
It is use to throw an exception                          It is use to declare an exception
One throw keyword can throw one                          One throws can declare any number of exception
exception
Throw keyword should be written                          Should be written together with method name                
inside the method
Syntax:                                                  Syntax:
throw new NullPointerException("Sorry file is empty");   public static void main(String[] args) throws NullPointerException



Type casting
Converting one type to another type is called type casting
It can be done in 2 ways
1) Primitive type casting
2) class type casting

Primitive type casting
Converting one datatype to another datatype is called as primitive type casting

Class type casting
Converting one class to another class is called as class type casting



Class 28

Types of primitive type casting
Narrowing 
Widening 


Lets convert int into double

whatever we wish to convert keep it at right hand side -> to what u want to convert that should be on left hand side
Ex - Converting laptop into Tv

Tv=laptop;

Widening can be done in 2 ways implicit and explicit
Converting into to double

Narrowing will be done explicit only

Converting double into int

Assignment
write age in byte data type and covert into short datatype




Class type casting
are of two types 
Upcasting
Downcasting

Upcasting - Converting child class object into super class Type is called as Upcasting
It can be done in 2 ways one is implicit and explicit


Downcasting- Converting super class type into child class object is called as Downcasting
It can be done only explicitly
Note- Downcasting can never be perform without upcast


Assignment
Parent class have 2 static methods and 2 non-staitic methods
Child class have 2 static methods and 2 non-staitic methods

do upcasting and downcasting


note
collection - Interface
collections - Class
both in java.util.package


Collection in Java
Collection is a framework in Java which can help us to create a data , delete a data , update the data and fetch the data
Basically it helps us to do the CURD functionality.
In Collection all the methods are API unlike array methods
Just because its a framework it allow us to perform a wider range of actions compare to array
In Collection we have so many classes , so many interfaces , etc
The root interface we have in collection is Iterable(I)
Collection framework started in Java version 1.2 and it is basically divided into 2 packages
java.util.Collection;
java.util.Map;

Types of Data Structure

Primitive DS
all those datatypes which are keywords like
byte
short
int
long
float
double
Boolean 
char

Non Primitive Data Structure
we have two Linear and non-linear

Linear Data Structure- try to store data in a single line
ex- String , Arrays, List , Set , Queue , ArrayList , LinkedList , HashSet , LinkedHashSet, etc.

Non Linear Data Structure- try to store data in notes and trees
ex-Graph , Trees


Class 29

Collection methods

Does it follow
Index -True
Hetrogenous - True
Dynamic - True as it has no fix size
null - True
order of insertion-True
duplicate-True
ways to iterate - Iterator 



Properties of List(I)  List l1 = new ArrayList(); //upcasting to use list methods
Does it follow
Index -true
Hetrogenous -true
Dynamic - true
null - true
order of insertion-true
duplicate-true
sorting - does not auto sort have to sort with Collections class sort method and list should have homogenous values
ways to iterate - Iterator and ListIterator


note-
Iterator- is applicable for entire collection
ListIterator- is only applicable for entire list hierarchy

Iterator	hasnext,next  can do forward iteration
ListIterator	hasnext,next,hasprevious,previous can do forward as well as backward iteration


Note- Backward iteration is not possible without forward iteration in ListIterator


Properties of Set(I)    Set s1 =new HashSet(); //upcasting to use set methods
Does it follow
Index - Does not follow indexing (false)
Hetrogenous -true
Dynamic - true
null - yes accept null but only 1
order of insertion- false
duplicate- does not accept duplicate
ways to iterate - Iterator 



Class 30

Iterator has hasNext() , next() also have remove()

ListIterator hasNext() , next() , hasPrevious(), previous() , remove() , set() - is use to replace the data


Assignment behaviour of each classes under List and Set 

	                           Index	Hetrogenious	Dynamic	  null	    order of insertion	duplicate	Iterator?	ListIteartor?   Sort

 Linked list
Diagram in diagram folder for doubly linked list

ArrayList and LinkedList difference

If u have to store the data in the form of indexing which interface among set and list which will u follow?
Ans- List


If u have to store the data with uniqness which interface among set and list which will u follow?
Ans- Set



Class 32

Difference between Collection and Collections


Collection
It is an interface
Collection inherits iterable interface
It consist of abstract methods
comes from java.util.collection package
Collection interface have many interfaces and classes in it

Collections
It is a class
It inherits Object class
Collections is a class which has all static methods
comes from java.util.collections package
Collections method can be utilized on collection interface or in its classes


Map Interface
Use to store data in pair key and value
Index- They dont follow indexing
order of insertion- They dont follow


Class 33
MapPro4
foreach loop
Difference between List Set and Map

Class 34

StringBuffer initial capacity is 16

StringBuffer and StringBuilder have 3 same constructors

something that can be change is called as mutable
something that cant be change is called as emutable

String - emutable
StringBuffer-mutable
StringBuilder-mutable

Class 35

Repeat all methods for StringBuilder

How String is immutable
Means it can not be change once its created 
Java uses a special memory area called String Pool for storing strings efficiently, when you create a string Java checks
if exact same string is already in the pool and if it is , then java uses that existing string instead of making a new one.
Strings can not be changed so they are good to use


What does synchronized means
what does non-synchronized means
StringBuffer vs StringBuilder
Thread safe and synchronized
growth strategies
diff bet ArrayList and Vector
diff bet Array and ArrayList

Class 36

GitHub
Its a code repository where u can store the code
we need 2 things
GitHub account-to store ur code and gitbash- a software from where u can push it


After creating account in GitHub then create a repository in GitHub

git --version

in the folder
git init - should be done only onece

git clone https://github.com/RohitJoshi0003/BasicsOfJava.git   - should not repeat


remote-GitHub
local-desktop


ls
list of files

cd name of folder to enter

git status
git add filename - for a particular file
git add . - all the files

git commit -m "meesage"

git push --all repository url

git pull reposirty url


How to move the control to main branch to another branch
$ git branch --all - to fetch name of all branches
git checkout -b branchName - this will create a new branch and move control to new branch
$ git checkout master-switch back to master branch




Polymorphism
An object showing different behaviour at different stages of its lifecycle is known as Polymorphism
It actually means same action in various ways
ex- 
Login- Login with mobile
Login - Login with email

ex- 
Payments-Net Banking
Payments-Credit Card
Payments-Debit Card
Payments-UPi
Payments-RTGS



Class 37

Polymorphism is of two types
1) Compile time polymorphism
An object showing different behaviour at different stages of its lifecycle during the compile time based on the arguments passed is called as Compile time polymorphism this can be achieved by method overloading


2) Runtime polymorphism
An object showing different behaviour at different stages of its lifecycle during the run time based on the object created is called as Run time polymorphism
this can be achieved by method overriding



Encapsulation
Restricting the access of the data member of the class by making it as a private is called as encapsulation
Providing the indirect access of those methods using getter and setter should be done for those data member
Rules
1) The data member whose access you want to restrict make it as a private
2) Provide 2 methods known as getter and setter for getting and setting values and these 2 methods should be public


Class 38-Test of core java till here

What is Object Oriented Programming
COAPIE
Class
Object
Abstraction
Polymorphism
Encapsulation
Inheritance


Which all languages are object oriented programming language
Java Python Ruby C# JavaScript, etc.

Which all languages are not object oriented programming language
Ada, Basic,  C, C++ Pascal Cobal, etc.


What is Diamond Problem in Java?
In case of multiple level inheritance using classes if the child class have the super() calling statement then it will be ambiguity(confusion) that
which parent class constructor to invoke this leads to a diamond problem 
Since both parent have the property of the object class the child will be confused from which parent it has to utilize the object class property 

How to find current time and past time in JAva
Date class can be used


Class 39

Selenium starts
Tool- that can automate web-based application-browsers

Advantages
can automate web-based application
can automate most of the browsers like chrome , firefox, safari ,edge ,internet explorer ,etc.
Its not platform dependent
it means we can run it in any operating system like- windows ,mac-os and ubuntu
Selenium can integrate with many other tools like TestNg,Maven, POI Jars etc which makes it a strong suite of tool
Selenium can integrate with Jenkins which is your  CI/CD tool to run the script directly in remote server


suite- means of collections of tools


Disadvantages
You cant automate mobile application
You cant automate standalone application- that does not needs internet like paint,calculator,etc
It cant automate capcha,barcodes,images,you are human,scanner,etc.


How to set-up selenium




How to launch browsers 
ChromeDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();
FirefoxDriver driver = new FirefoxDriver();
SafariDriver driver = new SafariDriver();


ctrl shift o for import required package


driver.get("String url"); - launch any url

driver.close();
will close parent browser tab or It closes that browser that has control

driver.quit();
will close parent and child browser/tab


driver.getwindowhandle();
will give you the browser id of parent tab or that tab that has control

driver.getwindowhandles();
will give you the browser id of parent tab and child tab 


Class 40

driver.getTitle();
getTitle will give u the title of the page


driver.findElement();
Use to find single element

Ex-Launch Google type India and click on search button
there are 2 elements 
search text field
search button
here we use findElement for finding 2 components separately




driver.findElements();
Use to find multiple elements
Ex- Count total Links of the page
here we use findElements bcs of many components 

In selenium we do

Find the element
driver.findElement();
driver.findElements();

Locate them
id
name
classname
tagname
xpath
css locator
Linktext
PartialLinktext

note- Locators are the static methods of By class


Perform action on it
click

TestNg
It stands for test next generation 
It is a framework which allows to do 
1) Parallel testing
2) Crossbrowser testing - also known as compatibility testing 
3) Data Driven testing- testing with multiple data
4) Generate Reports
5) Running many test cases together
6) Group Test Cases -can group test cases on the basis of type of testing 


How to configure TestNg in the java project
in TestNg no need of main method
because in TestNg we have Annotations concept


syntax of class in TestNg

class One
{
@Test
public void method1()

{


}
}	

Different Annotation in TestNG are
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite


Class 48

Order of execution will also be same
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite


Number of @Test decides number of test cases


For every @Test we have our own before and after method


when u have 2 Test present in program what will be  the order of execution
Alphabetic order of the method name

login 1
registration 2


parameter called priority
1
2
3
lower the priority first will execute

default priority of Test if not mentioned  is always zero

priority can be -ve

How to retry the failed testcases
IRetryAnalyzer(I)- its a interface

Steps Involved:	
1. Create a class and implements IRetryAnalyzer	
2. OVerride the unimplemented methods	
3. Write your own logics to retry the test cases	
4. Create a  seperate class/Test to utilise the IRetryAnalyzer

@Test(retryAnalyzer=packagename.classsname.class)"	


Class 52
Assertions in TestNG

we can use Class Assert

Data driven testing of selenium (excel sheet)
it is used for hiding the data as not required to keep in code

we need 
Apache POI jars


Class 54

Steps require to fetch the value from excel sheet
Non technical step required
1 Let the java know where exactly is excel sheet
2 Open the excel sheet
3 Go to the right sheet name
4 Go to the right row
5 Go to the right column
6 Fetch the cell using a method called "getStringCellvalue"


Technical steps
1 Using the class called FileInputStream let the java know where is excel sheet
2 Using the WorkbookFactory.create-> create the excel sheet return type is Workbook
3 Using getSheet ("Pass here the name of the sheet") return type is Sheet
"4. Using getRow(""pass here row value""
)
return typs is Row"
"5. Using getCell(""Pass here the cell index"")

return type is Cell"

"6 Fetch the Cell using a method called
""getStringCellvalue"""
return type is String




What will happen if the location of excel sheet is wrong
File not found

What will happen if u fetch an empty cell 
Null pointer exception


What will happen if u fetch the numeric value
Illegal State exception


Assignemnt
fetch values from excel sheet and then apply DataProvider 2X2 matrix

                     Login.java
                     Registration.java

Package 2 - test -   All the test cases will be present
                     TestCase1
                     TestCase2
                     TestCase3


In source file

Selenium Synchronization
can achieve in 3 ways 
1 implicit wait
driver.manage.timeouts.implicitlywait(Duration.ofsec(10))	

Duration is a class here
ofsec is a static method of Duration
It has many more static methods like
ofhours
ofdays
ofminisec
of min etc

if the element is not loaded in 10 sec then it give no element exception
it can be use for only find element and find elements method in selenium

Polling period of implicit wait is 500 milliseconds


2 explicit wait
WebDriverWait w1=new WebDriverWait (driver,Duration.ofsec(10));
w1.untill(ExpectedConditions.(list of methoods));

list of methods
are - titleIs, titleContains


WebDriverWait
Duration
ExpectedConditions			

Polling period of explicit wait is 500 milliseconds

if threshold time is 10 sec then after how much time it will keep checking expected condition is 500 milliseconds



What is TimeOut exception

3 fluent wait



Characteristic of a javascript pop-up
1 JavaScript pop-up will not inspectable pop-up means right click does not work here
2 JavaScript pop-up will give us maximum 2 option to select that will be true or false , do u agree or not agree
3 JavaScript pop-ups are mandatory to handle else will get unhandeled alert exception

What is soft and hard assert

TestNg assertion are hard assertion as whenever expected does not meet actual then execution stops
These are strict assertion
if assertion not true that it will not proceed further


For hard assertion concept of Selenium and Assert concept of TestNG both are hard assertion

Assertion a1 = new Assertion();


For Soft assertion
SoftAssert a1 = new SoftAssert();

 When an assertion fails, don't throw an exception but record the failure is soft assertion


Soft assert means if assertion fails it will continue the execution

copy the js path of of element by right click
then paste it and return type would be string
and add return in it
then use driver.executeScript
and then cast it into WebElement
then click on that WebElement

ex-

ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
	driver.get("https://www.airindia.com/");
	driver.manage().window().maximize();
	Thread.sleep(2000);
	WebElement e1=	driver.findElement(By.id("onetrust-accept-btn-handler"));
	e1.click();
	
	String s1="return 	document.querySelector('#ai-booking-widget > ai-tab-group > ai-tab:nth-child(1) > ai-search-flight > slot-fb > div.ai-search-flight-wrapper > div.ai-search-trip > div > div.ai-search-trip-type > ai-radio-group').shadowRoot.querySelector('div > div:nth-child(1) > label')";
